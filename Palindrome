Problem Statement:
Consider a scenario, where there exists two positive numbers 'n1' and 'n2'. The numbers 'n1' and 'n2' follows certain set of constraints:

They are always positive
They can never hold a value greater than 100
Compute the result 'r' using the formula given below:

r = max‚Å°(n1*n2) for all 10<=n1,n2<100, such that 'r' is equivalent to its reverse.
Input Format

The maximum value of 'n1' and 'n2'.

Do not print additional messages.

Constraints

10 <= n1, n2 < 100

Both are always positive.

Output Format

The result 'r', if it validates the state, print "Not a valid state" in case of non-valid state.

Do not print additional messages.

Sample Input 0

99
99
Sample Output 0

9009
Explanation 0

Value of 'n1' = 99

Value of 'n2' = 99

Hence, result 'r' = max (n1 * n2) and 'r' is a palindrome.
